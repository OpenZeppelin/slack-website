The OpenZeppelin community used to gather in slack. 
In https://slack.openzeppelin.org we hosted a [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin) landing page to help people to join.

Now we have migrated the community to the [forum](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions).
Read more about it here: https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/launching-the-zeppelin-community-forum-5a706c2397ab

This repository now hosts only a netlify redirect from the old slack landing page to the blog post that announces the migration.
